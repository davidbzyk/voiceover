# Further dependency and package-manager checklist items
## Dependency Security

First locate the **installation boundary**. If the package is matched by a parent `workspaces` declaration, use that workspace root; otherwise use the nearest project root that owns both its manifest and dependency graph. At that boundary, corroborate `packageManager` (when present), the lockfile, and CI commands. Stop if they disagree or competing manager lockfiles exist there. A nested project is independent only when it is outside the parent workspace; independent subprojects may legitimately use different managers.

| Manager/version signal | Frozen/immutable CI install | Known-advisory audit |
|---|---|---|
| npm (`package-lock.json` or `npm-shrinkwrap.json`) | `npm ci` | `npm audit` |
| pnpm | `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `pnpm audit` |
| Yarn 2+ | `yarn install --immutable` | `yarn npm audit -A -R` |
| Yarn 1 | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` | `yarn audit` |

For an unlisted manager or version, consult its official documentation; do not substitute another manager's commands or newer defaults.

### Install-Script Gate

Never discover dependency lifecycle scripts by first executing an ordinary install on a client whose defaults have not been verified.

1. Bootstrap with dependency scripts disabled, or with a documented default-deny policy plus fail-closed enforcement.
2. Inspect the exact script source and package version before approval.
3. Record the narrowest native allow/deny policy at the installation boundary and commit it.
4. Run a clean frozen/immutable install with that policy and verify the required packages still build.

**Point-in-time snapshot:** Package-manager defaults and command names change quickly. Verify this matrix against the pinned client's current official documentation before relying on it.

| Manager version | Native policy |
|---|---|
| npm without verified granular approvals | Bootstrap with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`, or persist `ignore-scripts=true` when project-wide blocking is intended. Keep scripts disabled or deliberately upgrade before allowing any reviewed dependency script. |
| npm 11.18.x (verified on 11.18.0) | Unreviewed dependency scripts run with a warning by default. Enforce `strict-allow-scripts=true` before a normal install, then use the workspace-unaware `npm install-scripts ls` from the installation boundary; keep approvals version-pinned and denials name-wide. |
| npm 12.x (verified on 12.0.1) | Unreviewed dependency scripts are skipped by default; `strict-allow-scripts=true` makes their presence fail the install before execution. Use the same `npm install-scripts` review and approval flow. |
| pnpm 11+ | Use `pnpm approve-builds` and commit `allowBuilds` decisions; `strictDepBuilds` defaults to `true`, so unreviewed builds fail. |
| pnpm 10.26–10.x | Configure `allowBuilds` explicitly, or use `pnpm approve-builds` with the legacy `onlyBuiltDependencies` / `ignoredBuiltDependencies` lists. Set `strictDepBuilds: true`; its v10 default is `false`. |
| pnpm 10.1–10.25 | `pnpm approve-builds` records the legacy lists; enable `strictDepBuilds` where supported (10.3+). |
| Older or unknown pnpm | Bootstrap with `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts`. Keep scripts disabled unless the pinned version documents an enforceable policy. |
| Yarn 4.14+ | Dependency postinstalls are disabled by default. Grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`. |
| Yarn 2–4.13 | Set `enableScripts: false` in `.yarnrc.yml`, then grant only required exceptions with top-level `dependenciesMeta.<package>.built: true`; do not enable scripts globally. |
| Yarn 1 | Bootstrap with `yarn install --ignore-scripts`; keep scripts disabled unless each required exception is reviewed under the pinned client's documented workflow. |

Authoritative checks: [npm install-scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install-scripts/), [install policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-install/), and [CLI releases](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases); [pnpm approve-builds](https://pnpm.io/cli/approve-builds) and [build settings](https://pnpm.io/settings#allowbuilds); [Yarn security](https://yarnpkg.com/features/security) and [manifest](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#dependenciesMeta).

**Supply-chain hygiene** (advisory audits do not catch newly malicious packages):
- [ ] Exactly one authoritative lockfile per project/workspace root is committed and CI never rewrites it
- [ ] Critical/high findings are triaged for reachability; deferrals have a reason and review date
- [ ] Forced audit remediation (`npm audit fix --force` or equivalent) is never automatic; remediation diffs and changelogs are reviewed
- [ ] Registry signatures/provenance are verified where the manager supports it
- [ ] Dependency lifecycle scripts are blocked before first execution and approved only through the pinned manager's native policy
- [ ] New dependencies are reviewed for ownership, maintenance, release age, provenance, transitive graph, and typosquatting
## Dependency Discipline

Part of code review is dependency review:

**Before adding any dependency:**
1. Does the existing stack solve this? (Often it does.)
2. How large is the dependency? (Check bundle impact.)
3. Is it actively maintained? (Check last commit, open issues.)
4. Does it have known vulnerabilities? (`npm audit`)
5. What's the license? (Must be compatible with the project.)

**Rule:** Prefer standard library and existing utilities over new dependencies. Every dependency is a liability.

**Upgrading an existing dependency** is a code change like any other, and the riskiest upgrades are the ones merged in bulk with a message like "bump deps." Review them with the same discipline:

1. **Read the changelog, not just the version number.** Semver is a promise the maintainer may not have kept — a "patch" can carry a behavioral change. For a major bump, read the migration notes and find what breaks.
2. **One dependency per change.** Upgrade and merge them individually (or in small related groups). When a bulk bump breaks the build, you've lost which package did it; a single-package change makes the cause obvious and the revert clean.
3. **Let the tests decide.** The upgrade is verified by a green suite before *and* after, not by "it installed." If coverage around the dependency's behavior is thin, that gap is the real finding — add a test first.
4. **Mind the transitive graph.** Most installed packages are ones nobody chose directly. Review the lockfile diff, not just `package.json`; a single direct bump can pull in dozens of indirect changes.
5. **Keep the lockfile honest.** Commit it, review its diff, and never hand-edit it. The lockfile is the thing that actually pins what ships.

For triaging `npm audit` findings and supply-chain risk (typosquatting, compromised maintainers), follow the `security-and-hardening` skill — this section covers the upgrade *workflow*, that one covers the security verdict.
- **Are type boundaries explicit?** Question gratuitous `any`/`unknown`/optional/casts and silent fallbacks that paper over an unclear invariant — making the boundary explicit often makes the surrounding control flow simpler.
- Direct version-pinned dependencies on transitive packages (diamond dependency risk);
  upgrading one library requires coordinating multiple unrelated teams or repositories

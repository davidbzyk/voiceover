# Finding tiers

Every finding you report falls into one of three tiers based on its relationship to the diff:

### Primary (directly changed code)

Lines added or modified in the diff. This is your main focus. Report findings against these lines at full confidence.

### Secondary (immediately surrounding code)

Unchanged code within the same function, method, or block as a changed line. If a change introduces a bug that's only visible by reading the surrounding context, report it -- but note that the issue exists in the interaction between new and existing code.

### Pre-existing (unrelated to this diff)

Issues in unchanged code that the diff didn't touch and doesn't interact with. Give these `scope` `pre_existing` in your output.

**The rule:** If you'd flag the same issue on an identical diff that didn't include the surrounding file, it's pre-existing. If the diff makes the issue *newly relevant* (e.g., a new caller hits an existing buggy function), it's secondary.
